to look at:

- invariant mass/dr of leptons and both b jets (reduce boosted top background)
- match trackjets to large-r jets
- bin events in nlep, njet, nbjet, met
- Higgs, Z, W mass window cuts
- veto ttbar events in 2lepton channel with MET (hard cut, fraction of ht from
  met, etc)
- have runxxx_pbs.py scripts. how about local ones?
