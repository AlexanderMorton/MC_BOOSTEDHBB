to look at:

- invariant mass/dr of leptons and both b jets (reduce boosted top background)
- bin events in nlep, njet, nbjet, met
- veto ttbar events in 2lepton channel with MET (hard cut, fraction of ht from
  met, etc)
- have runxxx_pbs.py scripts. how about local ones?
- akt4 and akt3 dijet mass peaks are right at higgs mass with current pt
  cuts...

- higgs, boson pt balance to reject ttbar
- only hack VH mass plot, not the rest of the pairs...
- fix labels, etc in plotting

- split events into 0-, 1-, and 2-leptons
